Data-Science
============

Just a small collection of my first projects. Some of them are from assignment tasks and in german language, which will be translated when I find the time. At the moment I am working on identifying faked interviews in surveys by using machine learning and Benford's Law. Program code related to a project for the LexisNexis News Archive is available upon request.
